# Ashley
If your here, you know.
You know of the pain I've been through.
You know of what you've done.
And somehow, your still doing what your doing.
You took my Ashley and your still rummaging through the glory of your story.
I know you like the rhyming.
You were my favorite.
Then you do this to me.
You ruined me.
You ruined her.
You ruined everything.
Well maybe I can show you my side.
You have a whole audience as well.
Isn't that right.
